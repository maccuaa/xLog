# xLog

### Description

xLog is a log file viewer.  It's simple. It's boring. 

It's a project I built so that I could learn about building apps with Electron, and trying out different web frameworks.  I started out with Angular but soon realized it wasn't the right fit for what I was trying to do.  While billing itself as a single page web application framework, it was still too big and heavy for my purposes. After doing some research I stumbled across [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and I haven't looked back since.

**This app is still in development and is by no means close to finished**
